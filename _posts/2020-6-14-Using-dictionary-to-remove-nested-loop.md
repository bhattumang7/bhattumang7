Let us look at a software performance problem/slowness which I fixed in the VB6 code.
The slowness was when opening a form that showed all the administrators and then rendered a selection of those administrators. You could select a few administrators and those will show as selected when you open the same form again. 
Somehow the administrator userâ€™s information and the information about who all are selected were stored in different database tables. 
Original code worked fine for a few years but, once the amount of data grew if the user had selected a few thousand administrators; loading the screen took a few minutes. 

The original code was written something like below:

```vb

Private Sub DisplayAdministrators()
    Const myProcName = "DisplayAdministrators"
    
    'define columns in administrator array
    Const f_AdminId = 0
    Const f_AdminAbbr = 1
    Const f_Name = 2 

    Dim lng As Long
    Dim lngRow As Long
    Dim lngTopRow As Long
    Dim vntAdministrators As Variant

    'fill administrators grid
    vntAdministrators = m_objClient.GetAllAdministrators()
    
    If Not IsEmpty(vntAdministrators) Then
        With grdAdministrators
            .Redraw = False
            .MaxRows = UBound(vntAdministrators, 2) + 1
            For lngRow = 0 To UBound(vntAdministrators, 2)
                .Row = lngRow + 1
                .Col = 0
                .Text = vntAdministrators(f_AdminId, lngRow)
                .Col = 1
                .Text = vntAdministrators(f_AdminAbbr, lngRow)
                .Col = 2
                .Text = vntAdministrators(f_Name, lngRow)
            Next lngRow
            .Redraw = True
        End With
        
        'set active row and select rows for any AdministratorISs passed in
        With grdAdministrators
            lngTopRow = .MaxRows
            For lng = 0 To UBound(m_vntSelectedIDs)
                For lngRow = 1 To .MaxRows
                    .Row = lngRow
                    .Col = 0
                    If m_vntSelectedIDs(lng) = .Text Then
                        If lngTopRow >= lngRow Then
                            lngTopRow = lngRow
                        End If
                    End If
                Next lngRow
            Next lng
            .Col = 2
            .Row = lngTopRow
            .Action = ActionActiveCell
            For lng = 0 To UBound(m_vntSelectedIDs)
                For lngRow = 0 To .MaxRows
                    .Row = lngRow
                    .Col = 0
                    If m_vntSelectedIDs(lng) = .Text Then
                        .SelModeSelected = True
                    End If
                Next lngRow
            Next lng
            .Row = .ActiveRow
        End With
    
    End If
End Sub

```
