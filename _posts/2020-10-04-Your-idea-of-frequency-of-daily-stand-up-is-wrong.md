For most people, "Agile" is a word spoken every day. The problem with them is that they never learned from the original masters. What they have learned from are mostly 3rd hand accounts of the original version of Agile software development (similar to [Chinese whispers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers)). A lot of them have never heard the names of people who created the Agile manifesto. A lot of them have never seen the original authors speak in a video. Most of them have near read a book written by the original authors. The books from original authors sound nothing like the things people talk about (for example, "Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#", "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change" and "Writing Effective Use Cases"). Let alone books, a lot of Indians even can not pronounce the names of the original author (try 'Alistair Cockburn').

After having read this far, you will say: "No Umang, I am aware of the practices."

My response is: "okay, please take a test by answering my question.". 

#### How frequently is an agile team supposed to meet for "The Daily Scrum" or the "Standup Meeting."?

Now, let us look at a portion from the book "Clean Agile: Back to Basics" by Robert C. Martin that will answer the above question. Oh! And, because you are Agile ninja, I don't have to tell you that Robert C. Martin is one of the original authors of Agile manifesto.

Let us look at what he says:

> Over the years, there has been a great deal of confusion about “The Daily Scrum” or the “Standup Meeting.” Let me cut through all that confusion now.
> The following are true of the Standup Meeting:
> * **This meeting is optional. Many teams get by just fine without one.**
> * It can be less often than daily. Pick the schedule that makes sense to you.
> * It should take ∼10 minutes, even for large teams.
> 
> This meeting follows a simple formula.
> The basic idea is that the team members stand (this is why it’s called a “standup” meeting) in a circle and answer three questions:
> * What did I do since the last meeting?
> * What will I do until the next meeting?
> * What is in my way?
