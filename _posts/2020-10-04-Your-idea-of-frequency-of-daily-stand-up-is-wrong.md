description: In this post, we will learn from Robert C Martin about misconceptions around 'how frequently should stand-up/scrum should happen'.

For most people, "Agile" is a word spoken every day. The problem with them is that they never learned from the original masters. What they have learned from are mostly 3rd hand accounts of the original version of Agile software development (similar to "[Chinese whispers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers)"). Lot of them have never heard the names of the authors of the Agile manifesto. A lot of them have never seen the original authors speak in a video. Most of them have near read a book written by the original authors.  The books from original authors sound nothing like the things people talk about (for example, "Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#", "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change" and "Writing Effective Use Cases". Let alone books, a lot of Indians even can not pronounce the names of the original author (try 'Alistair Cockburn').

After having read this far, you will say: "No Umang, I am aware of the practices."

My response is: "okay, please take a test by answering my question.". 

#### How frequently is an agile team supposed to meet for "The Daily Scrum" or the "Standup Meeting."?
