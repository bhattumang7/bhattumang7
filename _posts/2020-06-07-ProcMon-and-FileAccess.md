description: ProcMon can be used to diagnose the file access related errors. Let us use ProcMon to see what files are being accessed by the application.

Once someone contacted me to understand an error. The error read "Run-time error '76' Path Not found". The application developer had written correct error logging and it included error message and error number. The only thing that was not logged was the path that was being accessed. Here is how the error looked like:

![Run-time error ‘76’ Path Not found](../assets/blog_pictures/2020-06-07-ProcMon-and-FileAccess/Post_ProcMon_app_error.jpg)

Diagnosing this type of problem in a large application with millions of lines of is pretty hard. In a production environment without looking at the code, finding the file which is being accessed by application is pretty hard. 
The first tool that I try when looking at a problem like this is [ProcMon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) from Sysinternals.

The first thing I do after launching ProcMon is to disable event capturing by pressing "Ctrl+E" (by default even capturing enabled once we launch ProcMon). 
Next step is to configure ProcMon to look at the events generated by specific application. We do it by pressing "Ctrl+L" and then adding our executable to filter list. Here is a screenshot:

Now, we come back to the application. We reach up to the step which errors out, but don't perform that operation (for example, if clicking on a button throws an error, reach up to the step to be able to click on it but don't click on it). Now, come back to ProcMon and press "Ctrl+E" which will re-enable even capture. Once that is done, click on the button which throws an error in your application.
Doing this will generate a log that will look something like below:
![ProcMon logs](../assets/blog_pictures/2020-06-07-ProcMon-and-FileAccess/procmon_logs.jpg)

Once you have got the error, come back to ProcMon and press "Ctrl+E" again to disable the event capture. 

At this step, we have got the ProcMon log captured. Now comes the tricky part to co-relate the application error with the entries in ProcMon.

Here are a few things you can try:
- Start from the bottom of the log and go upwards.
- Try to co-relate the time of error with the actual error.
- If you have a separate DLL having UI for showing error (form to show the error to a user), look for that DLL in the logs first and then go upwards. 
- If the error is path not found then directly filter for "path not found" in results column.
- If the error is access denied then you might have to go through a lot of entries to find the right once. 
- You can also use ProcMon to monitor Registry, Network, Process, and thread activity. 
- If you two subsequent rows for the same path where the first is access denied and the subsequent request is a success, you can ignore the first one. It is Windows's way of making sure that the user has access to the requested resource.

In my case, simply having the filter for not found took me the file it was looking for:

ProcMon is a very powerful tool. Read the documentation to understand it further.
