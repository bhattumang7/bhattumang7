# **About Umang**

Hi! I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
Welcome to my blog. I work as a Senior Software Engineer at Allscripts. 
Using this blog, I intend to share some of my ideas and learning. 

Here are the software engineering related activities that I am involved with:
- New software development.
- [Level 3 Support Engineering](https://medium.com/@harshanacslab/what-is-l1-l2-and-l3-support-engineering-6e9ca20c1dbb)
- Software performance measurement (Windows Performance recorder and analyzer, ANTS profiler, etc).
- Software Performance Tunning.

My personality type is [ISTJ (“THE LOGISTICIAN”)](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality) and [MindTime archetype](https://www.mindtime.com/archetypes/) is "[Past - The Truth Seeker](https://www.mindtime.com/archetypes/truth-seeker/)". I am one of the rare people who's StrengthsFinder 2.0 results span all 4 talents - Strategic Thinking, Executing, Influencing, and Relationship-building:
- [Learner](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/cms/en-us/gmj/694/learner)
- [Connectedness](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/cms/en-us/gmj/649/connectedness)
- [Intellection](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/cms/en-us/gmj/691/intellection)
- [Maximizer](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/cms/en-us/gmj/697/maximizer)
- [Deliberative](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/cms/en-us/gmj/658/deliberative)

Apart from being a software engineer, I enjoy most of my time taking care of my daughter, clicking pictures using off camera flash (with my canon) or growing roses. I also happen to love to ride on my Enfield Desert Storm. I also practice programming and learning new techniques in my free time.
I also like to take out a fair share of time for family.
