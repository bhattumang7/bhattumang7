# **About Me**

Him I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I work as a Senior Software Engineer in a company responsible for creating software for health care.

My personality type is [ISTJ (“THE LOGISTICIAN”)](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality) and [MindTime archetype](https://www.mindtime.com/archetypes/) is "[Past - The Truth Seeker](https://www.mindtime.com/archetypes/truth-seeker/)". I am one of the rare people who's StrengthsFinder 2.0 results span all 4 talents - Strategic Thinking, Executing, Influencing and Relationship-building:

Apart from being a software engineer, I enjoy most of my time clicking pictures, reading books, sipping coffee, or watching movies. I also happen to love to ride on my Enfield Desert Storm. I also practice programming and learning new techniques in my free time.
I also like to take out a fair share of time for family.
